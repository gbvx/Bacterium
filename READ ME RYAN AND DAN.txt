I am choosing not to upload the visual studio solution of this project due to locking it down to a windows platform.
If you would like for me to upload a vs project then just contact me and I will upload it in a separate repository 
entitled 'Bacterium-VS2010'

Ryan: 
Suggestion: Have a builds folder. Inside this will have builds of this project for each OS.
Example of folder structure:
Builds -> Windows -> Bacterium.sln
       -> Linux -> ...
